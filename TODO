List of ideas and concepts that might be worth spending the time to do.

- Modify the view to incorporate some new gtk style features like what the
  documents and boxes applications use, for example see
  https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-boxes/blob/master/src/display-page.vala
  - this also has some interesting signal usage through connect_after in the
    DisplayBar class for fullscreen

- Rename Dactl.Application to Dactl.Launcher or copy what was done in
  gnome-boxes for main
- Change Dactl.ApplicationWindow to Dactl.ApplicationView
- Create Dactl.Application base for UI and CLI
- Have main generate app and view
- Seperate the CLI application and view
- Add a UI.Manager class, possibly UI.UxManager
- The view should load and signal that it's ready for population to the
  controller, the model is then used to walk the config tree for UI elements
  and the view adds them using the manager class (?)
- Add a UI.Layout class (?), or just use Clutter layouts with the manager
